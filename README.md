### Mini React App
This is a quick app I created to practice React basics during my first week of learning React at CodeClan. The app displays links to some films and to the top films in the UK on IMDB.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm `i
Installs all npm dependencies required to run the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
